1. RANDOM FORESTS
    Random forest is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for solving classification and
    regression problems. It is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to create a
    more accurate and stable model. Random forest is particularly useful for handling large datasets
    with complex features, as it is able to select the most important features and reduce overfitting.

    Random forest algorithms can be expensive to train and are really hard to interpret model performance
    as opposed to decision trees. Let's look at some use cases of random forests.
